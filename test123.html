Imagine this. It’s November 9th, Wednesday morning. You hear a knock on your door. Standing on your welcome mat is Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. He’s wearing his black robe, his pale blue eyes and dimpled chin gleaming in the early morning sun. He tells you the presidential election was a virtual tie, but they’ve discovered a loophole. Instead of either candidate, they’re giving you the presidency. You just have to select your positions from the two options presented by the candidates.
