## What is the GR8 package?
252 ball FBGA package.

## I have a prototype of my product, is GR8 right for me?
Depends! For most customers, C.H.I.P. Pro will be the best way to work with GR8. We’ve already sourced 127 components for you and include all the working drivers. If you’ve tried C.H.I.P. Pro but are looking for a differently layout, then GR8 is a great option.

## Do you offer custom flashing solutions?
For C.H.I.P. Pro yes! For GR8, no, but it still works with Gadget to build, deploy and manage your products software.

## Who are some of the companies using GR8 in their products?
Oh wow. We cannot wait to tell you. Stay tuned. Stay very, very tuned.

## I’m a distributor, can I carry GR8?
Sure! We want to talk to you. Contact us at [sales@nextthing.co](mailto:sales@nextthing.co).
