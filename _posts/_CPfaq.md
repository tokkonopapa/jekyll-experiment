# C.H.I.P. Pro FAQ

## How much does C.H.I.P. Pro cost?
C.H.I.P. Pro costs $16. Contact [sales@nextthing.co](mailto:sales@nextthing.co)
(pre-flashing available for large orders).

## Are there quantity discounts?
C.H.I.P. Pro is $16 no matter how many you order. But, if you have to ask you should contact [sales@nextthing.co](mailto:sales@nextthing.co). 

## Is the C.H.I.P. Pro open source?
Yes, you can see our design files in our [git repository](https://github.com/NextThingCo/CHIP_Pro-Hardware).

## Does C.H.I.P. Pro replace C.H.I.P.?
C.H.I.P. is still a huge part of what we do. We made C.H.I.P. Pro and Gadget so the enterprising members of the CHIPster community would have a great option for scalable hardware, software and infrastructure for their products.

## Where can I buy the C.H.I.P. Pro?
Currently, we’re offering the C.H.I.P. Pro Dev kit for $49 in our [web store](https://nextthing.co/pages/store).

##  How many may I order?
As many or as few as you’d like. 1 to 1 million (or more). For larger orders, hit us up at [sales@nextthing.co](mailto:sales@nextthing.co)

## When will C.H.I.P. Pro ship?
C.H.I.P. Pro Dev kits are shipping in late Q4 of 2016 and C.H.I.P. Pro will be available in any quantity starting Q1 of 2017.

##  What is the lead time on a C.H.I.P. Pro order?
Once available in Q1 of 2017, small orders (1-20) will ship immediately. For large orders taking advantage of our factory flashing offering, there will be a lead time of 60 days.

##  I made a C.H.I.P. prototype, will it be hardware and software compatible with GR8?
Yes! GR8 has the same Allwinner R8 processor that is in C.H.I.P., so your C.H.I.P. software is 100% compatible with C.H.I.P. Pro. We believe you shouldn’t have to change your software to go into production.

## What does FCC Modular Certification mean?
C.H.I.P. Pro is CE, IC, and FCC Part 15B Modular Transmitter certified for use with multiple commercially available [external antennas](https://docs.getchip.com/chip_pro_devkit.html#wifi-antenna) as well as the onboard ceramic SMT antenna. Any products based on C.H.I.P. Pro will not require your company to run certification testing for the unintentional radiator portion of FCC tests, specifically FCC Part 15B. This will save you around 50% in testing time and cost associated with taking your product through FCC certification. You will still need to run FCC Part 15C tests (EMC testing for the intentional radiator portion). You will not need to apply for a new FCC-ID for your product; when you process your application with a certified test lab, they will file a Class II Permissive Change under NTC's FCC-ID.
